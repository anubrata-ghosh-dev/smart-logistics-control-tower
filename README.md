🚚 Smart Logistics Control Tower

Predictive Supply Chain Disruption & Resource Allocation System


📌 Problem Statement

Modern global supply chains operate across complex and volatile transportation networks. Disruptions such as extreme weather, traffic congestion, and operational bottlenecks are often identified only after delays occur, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and missed delivery deadlines.


## 💡 Our Solution

We built a Predictive Supply Chain Control Tower that enables real-time monitoring, disruption prediction, and intelligent resource allocation.
```
Instead of reacting to delays, our system:
	•	Detects potential risks in advance
	•	Predicts shipment delays
	•	Suggests optimized routes and resource reallocation
```

## 🎯 Key Features
```
🚀 Real-Time Shipment Tracking
	•	Simulated live tracking of shipments
	•	Displays route, speed, and ETA

⚠️ Disruption Prediction Engine
	•	Detects risks using:
	•	Weather conditions
	•	Traffic congestion
	•	Speed anomalies
	•	Assigns a risk score to each shipment

🔄 Smart Resource Allocation
	•	Suggests:
	•	Alternate routes
	•	Shipment prioritization
	•	Dynamic rerouting decisions

📊 Interactive Dashboard
	•	Visual map-based tracking
	•	Real-time alerts
	•	Actionable insights
```

## 🧠 System Architecture

```Data Sources → Backend (FastAPI) → Prediction Engine → Allocation Engine → Frontend Dashboard```

## Components:
```
	•	Input Layer: Shipment + external APIs (weather, traffic)
	•	Prediction Engine: Identifies potential disruptions
	•	Allocation Engine: Suggests optimized decisions
	•	Frontend: Displays insights and alerts
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

```
Backend:
	•	Python
	•	FastAPI

Frontend:
	•	React (Vite)

Database:
	•	SQLite (initial)

APIs:
	•	OpenWeather API
	•	Map APIs (Leaflet / Google Maps)
```
